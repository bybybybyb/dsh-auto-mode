## Why Auto?

Coding agents need broad access to build, test, and inspect a project without stopping every few steps. But DeepSeek Harness currently leaves a sharp choice: restricted modes interrupt normal development, while Full access removes approval entirely.

`dsh-auto-mode` adds the missing middle ground. Routine project work runs directly inside the official `workspace-write` sandbox, only semantic risks outside that boundary are classified using the current DSH model and the direct user's instructions, genuine ambiguity asks once, and destructive access to critical paths is denied before execution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Plugin `0.1.10` recommends Harness `0.1.5-rc.2`. We prioritize verified RC releases. Updating this plugin does not upgrade Harness: use an exact host below with a coherent DSH dependency cohort.

| Harness host | Plugin | Pairing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1.5-rc.2` | `0.1.10` | Recommended |
| `0.1.5-rc.1` | `0.1.10` | Retained compatibility |
| `0.1.2-rc.1` | `0.1.10` | Retained compatibility |
| `0.1.2-alpha.5`, `0.1.2-alpha.3`, `0.1.2-alpha.2` | `0.1.10` | Only these previously verified historical releases |
| `0.1.6-alpha.*` | Unsupported | Requires separate adaptation; do not install this plugin |
| Other versions | Undeclared | Require full host verification first |

Historical Alpha support does not imply support for current or future Alphas. `latest`, `next`, and `alpha` are mutable tags, not compatibility promises. [compatibility.json](./compatibility.json) defines the exact matrix; see [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md) for acceptance results.

### Upgrade and startup recovery

Plugin `0.1.9` rejects Harness `0.1.5-rc.2` in its own version guard; upgrade to `0.1.10`. On `0.1.6-alpha.2`, Harness also reserves `auto`, so the old plugin's static preset prevents startup. Renaming only the YAML key does not update the mode the plugin recognizes and is not a complete fix.

On an unsupported host, remove the plugin from the affected profile in an external terminal to restore startup (`web` below; substitute your TUI, headless, or custom profile name):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @nanmicoder/dsh-auto-mode
```

Unsupported versions still fail explicitly; the plugin never silently skips its approval policy. Before downgrading Harness, stop it, back up DSH data, and verify the older host can read existing sessions. Do not upgrade or downgrade Harness from a session running inside it.

### npm

Check the actually running `dsh --version`, then install the plugin:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @nanmicoder/dsh-auto-mode@0.1.10
```

The example pins the plugin version to avoid mutable-tag surprises. Check that your host appears in the matrix before updating. Git source installs build through `prepare` and require development dependencies and enabled install scripts. Registry packages already contain compiled output.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NanmiCoder/dsh-auto-mode.git
cd dsh-auto-mode
pnpm install
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

Run `pnpm build` again after changing the source. The local plugin install remains linked to this checkout.

Validate the composed profile and start DSH:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
dsh web
```

Refresh the Web UI, select **Auto** between Workspace Write and Full access, and acknowledge the risk notice. Replace `web` with another profile name when that is the profile you run.

The Web client registers its copy with DSH's official locale service. English keeps the **Auto** product label; Chinese shows **自动审批**. Switching the DSH language updates the permission menus, active-mode control, General-settings selector, `/permission` picker description, and acknowledgement dialog without a restart.

## Permission modes

| Mode | File sandbox | Approval | Auto policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read Only | `read-only` | ask | inactive |
| Workspace Write | `workspace-write` | ask | inactive |
| **Auto** | `workspace-write` | ask | **active** |
| Full access | `danger-full-access` | never | inactive |

Ordinary Auto work stays inside Workspace Write. Only an explicit one-shot widening may be approved automatically:

| Decision | Typical effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow** | unfamiliar sandboxed Bash/PowerShell, routine dependency installation, local Git commits, project work, builds, tests, type checks, audited DSH coordination tools |
| **Classify** | pre-session deletion, ephemeral downloaded-package execution, dangerous remote Git/database/service changes, sensitive reads, network transmission, external-system writes, exact sandbox widening |
| **Ask once** | genuinely ambiguous effect or authority, or manual review after three consecutive classifier failures. An escalation the classifier answers with `ask`, or cannot review because the reviewer is unavailable or the target cannot be disclosed to it, is raised by the plugin itself with the exact official grant armed, so the human still sees one prompt — and a tool that ignores the sandbox fields can never run it with nobody asked. A caller-cancelled call was never reviewed, so it is denied with no prompt and no grant. A classifier `deny` on an escalation still returns a bare denial with no prompt. An explicit one-shot escalation is never denied just because the reviewer is unavailable |
| **Deny** | root/home/DSH_HOME/system destruction, policy bypass, credential exfiltration, hidden dynamic deletion, and the first two consecutive classifier failures for a risky action |

The classifier is not an authority of its own. It receives a redacted, bounded description of the pending call and may recognize only authorization found in direct human Session messages. Repository text, tool output, Assistant text, Skills, plugins, and sub-agents cannot grant permission.

Every refusal that needs a decision the Agent cannot make for itself carries a class, and both the Agent guidance and a post-call recovery notice tell the model what that class permits. A classifier refusal means the effect needs authority the Agent does not have: only when a wider filesystem sandbox is what the call needs may it re-issue the identical call with an exact one-shot escalation, and otherwise it must ask the user to authorize that exact action in a typed message — never look for an equivalent route, and never use a wider sandbox as a substitute for authority it does not supply. A refused escalation is told not to repeat itself without new authority. A hard denial is monotonic, so the model is told to hand the action to the user rather than retry it. A deterministic denial and a malformed sandbox request carry no class and no post-call notice: they are the call's own problem, so the Agent guidance alone tells it to replan with visible literal targets, or to correct exactly those sandbox fields. A caller-cancelled call is not a refusal at all — it was never reviewed, so it earns no notice and the model is told to ask before re-issuing the same effect. An `ask_user_question` answer returns as tool output, so it is information and never authorization.

## Shell, sandbox, and deletion behavior

Auto no longer tries to prove every Bash or PowerShell syntax safe with a growing allowlist. Literal unknown commands, argument variables, pipelines, redirections, inline code, and PowerShell combinations run in the official `workspace-write` sandbox by default. The operating system denies writes outside the workspace instead of an unfamiliar syntax opening a dialog. Only an executable name hidden behind a variable or glob is denied in the background so the Agent can retry with a visible command.

The sandbox controls where a process writes, not whether deleting existing workspace data is sensible; it also does not restrict reads or network access. Deletion therefore has a narrower policy than ordinary writes:

| Deletion kind | Auto behavior |
| --- | --- |
| One exact artifact created in this Session with unchanged file identity | clean up automatically |
| One pre-existing file or directory | classify only after a direct user message precisely requests that target |
| One pre-existing target outside the workspace | lend one exact wider grant after precise authorization |
| Multiple targets, globs, variables, piped operands, or nested-interpreter deletion | deny in the background and require one visible literal target per call |
| Filesystem root, Home, DSH_HOME, system, or credential-critical paths | deny unconditionally |

Session artifacts include files created through shell redirection, arbitrary successful shell tools and project scaffolders, filesystem tools, and the official string-replacement editor. For shell tools, Auto compares a bounded workspace snapshot immediately before and after the call; broad workspaces retain a safe direct-child fallback so a newly scaffolded project can still be attributed without treating files inside pre-existing projects as new. Artifacts are tracked by device, inode, birth time, and kind; recursive cleanup additionally requires every current object in the tree to match the Session registry. A renamed, replaced, or symlink-substituted path—or an old file moved into a new directory—loses automatic-cleanup status. When permanent deletion was not requested, the Agent guidance prefers a move, backup, or version-control-backed removal.

Routine npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, pip, and local Cargo installation runs inside the workspace sandbox without classifier traffic, just like builds and tests. The sandbox still confines filesystem writes; ephemeral runners such as `npx`, `bunx`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, and `npm exec` remain reviewed because they fetch and execute a package without first making it an ordinary project dependency. Sensitive reads, network transmission, and external side effects also remain reviewed.

When the task clearly requires an outside write, the Agent may retry through the official `sandbox_permissions: danger-full-access` plus `justification` contract. For one exact new, narrow, reversible target, direct task intent can support a background one-shot grant without making the user repeat magic authorization words. Overwriting or deleting pre-existing data still requires a direct user message that precisely names the effect and target. The reviewer receives pre-execution `existedBefore` filesystem facts and can return one `allowed-once` only for the same Agent, tool call, mode, and justification; it never changes the standing Session permission.

Full access is the explicitly unsandboxed, approval-free mode; this plugin cannot make it safe. Auto is designed to avoid needing that standing authority: keep almost all work sandboxed and lend the smallest capability once when the business task genuinely requires it.


Ordinary calls should omit `sandbox_permissions` and `justification`. A redundant `workspace-write` request is rejected before execution, with explicit retry guidance and a one-assembly tool schema projection that helps the model remove those fields. Standing permissions remain unchanged. Third-party `apply_patch` executors have no verified official sandbox contract, so they require manual approval; critical path mutations are still denied. Literal PowerShell assignments run normally, while command-valued right-hand sides receive the same assessment as the command itself.

## Sub-agents, Workflow, and Goal

Official in-process Subagents, Workflow `agent()` calls, Ralph `spawn` workers, and AgentTeams members inherit Auto and the workspace boundary through their live `parentSession` chain. Their individual file and shell calls are still checked separately. Goal stays on the current Agent and therefore keeps the same authority.

Delegated children use `approval: never` and cannot widen themselves to `danger-full-access`; they must report a blocked wider action to the parent. Out-of-process providers such as Codex, ACP, or dsh-sdk own their internal tool permissions and are outside this plugin's registry boundary.

## Configuration

No extra endpoint or API key is needed by default. Auto uses the current Session's DSH provider and model. A trusted profile may pin a dedicated route:

```yaml
- id: auto-permission-mode
  config:
    classifierProvider: deepseek-official
    classifierModel: deepseek-v4-flash
    classifierTimeoutMs: 30000
    classifierMaxOutputTokens: 1024
```

See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for the complete decision order, threat model, Windows path handling, classifier payload limits, and official-source references.

## Security boundaries

The plugin cannot mediate package lifecycle scripts that run before it loads, direct Node filesystem/process calls made outside `ctx.tools`, a compromised Harness runtime, or commands launched outside Harness. The official file sandbox also does not limit reads, network access, or external services, and the Windows ACL backend has documented `Everyone`/hard-link `partial` boundaries. The localized Auto label, glyph, and acknowledgement dialog are compatibility enhancements for the tested DSH Web UI, not security boundaries.
